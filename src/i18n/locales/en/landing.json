      },
      {
        "question": "What does the process of obtaining sick leave look like?",
        "answer": "The process consists of three simple steps: 1) Fill out the online medical form (5 minutes), 2) The doctor will conduct a phone consultation, 3) You'll receive e-sick leave that automatically goes to ZUS and your employer. The whole process takes a maximum of 30 minutes."
